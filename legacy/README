This folder contains legacy scripts that were created. These may not function properly now since Timesketch has gone through various version changes. 

<h2>Bulk Upload Automated Handling</h2>
Following shell script can be used on the processing server to automate the following tasks once a zip file gets uploaded.
This script was inspired by https://github.com/ReconInfoSec/velociraptor-to-timesketch and https://github.com/mpilking/for608-public.
1. Validate that the uploaded is a zip file and extracts to a unique directory
2. Execute Log2timeline workflow on top of the data set
3. Execute Timesketch workflow taking the newly generated Plaso file
4. Remove the ZIP and extracted directory
